## Part 2 - IP Addressing Table and VLANs

The network uses a structured IP addressing schema to assign specific subnets to each department, ensuring efficient traffic management and reducing the risk of IP conflicts. Dynamic IP assignment is managed by a centralized DHCP server, which is configured with different scopes for each VLAN. This dynamic assignment simplifies network expansion and reduces manual configuration errors.

- **Management VLAN**: Assigned to subnet ...
- **Study VLAN**:
- **Production VLAN**:
- **Support 1 VLAN**:
- **Support 2 VLAN**:

Inter-VLAN routing is handled by Layer 3 switches, ensuring seamless communication between departments while still maintaining traffic segmentation. Specific Access Control Lists (ACLs) further restrict unnecessary communication between certain VLANs, protecting sensitive resources like Managementâ€™s assets from being accessed by Production or Support sectors.
