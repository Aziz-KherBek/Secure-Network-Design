## Part 2 - IP Addressing Table and VLANs

The network uses a structured IP addressing schema to assign specific subnets to each department, ensuring efficient traffic management and reducing the risk of IP conflicts. Dynamic IP assignment is managed by a centralized DHCP server, which is configured with different scopes for each VLAN. This dynamic assignment simplifies network expansion and reduces manual configuration errors.

- **Management VLAN**: VLAN 10 192.168.10.0/26
- **Study VLAN**: VLAN 20 192.168.10.64/26
- **Production VLAN**: VLAN 30 192.168.10.128/26
- **Support 1 VLAN**: VLAN 40 192.168.10.192/26
- **VOICE VLAN**: VLAN 50 192.168.11.0/26
- **NATIVE VLAN**: VLAN 99
- **DHCP/DNS**: 8.8.8.8/8
- **iSCSI storage server**: 192.168.100.2/30
- **RADIUS SERVER**: 10.0.0.3/29
- **MULTI LAYER SWITCH**:

Inter-VLAN routing is handled by Layer 3 switches, ensuring seamless communication between departments while still maintaining traffic segmentation. Specific Access Control Lists (ACLs) further restrict unnecessary communication between certain VLANs, protecting sensitive resources like Managementâ€™s assets from being accessed by Production or Support sectors.
