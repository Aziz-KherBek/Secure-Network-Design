## Part 4 - Security Measures

### 1. Introduction
Security was a primary focus during network design, with several key measures implemented to safeguard the networkâ€™s assets and data.

### 2. Detailed Reasoning
- **VLANs and ACLs**: Segmenting the network with VLANs and using ACLs limits lateral movement in the event of a breach.
  
- **RADIUS for Centralized Authentication**: Strong authentication protocols enforce secure access to critical network devices.
  
- **Password Policies and Encryption**: Strong password policies and encryption protect against brute force attacks and ensure data privacy.

### 3. Key Considerations
- **Minimizing Attack Surface**: Isolating network traffic into sectors and limiting communication via ACLs significantly reduces the attack surface.
  
- **Centralized Authentication Benefits**: Centralized authentication through RADIUS strengthens overall security.
