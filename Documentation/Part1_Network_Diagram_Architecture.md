## Part 1 - Network Diagram and Architecture

### 1. Introduction
The network architecture is structured into five distinct sectors: Management, Study, Production, Support 1, and Support 2. Each department is allocated its own VLAN to ensure traffic segmentation, preventing unauthorized lateral movement between departments and reducing the attack surface in case of a breach.

Our architecture moves two computers from Management and Support 1 to the Server Room which differs from the original requirements. Moving computers to the Server Room allows closer monitoring and management of devices that may serve administrative roles, centralizing critical infrastructure.

### 2. Key architectural components
- **Management VLAN**: Responsible for administrative operations, housing 4 computers, a printer, and IP phone. Segmentation via VLAN isolates these from production sectors, minimizing risk
- **Study VLAN**: Contains 8 computers and a printer, supporting research and study operations.
- **Production VLAN**: Consists of 10 workstations and handles the core production tasks. Production areas have the highest number of computers, which is appropriate given their workload
- **Support 1 and Support 2 VLANs**: Each support sector contains 9 and 10 computers respectively, supporting technical and customer service operations. Moving one computer from Support 1 to the Server Room does not significantly affect the sector, but ensure tasks in Support 1 can still be handled.
- **Server Room**: 2 computers (moved from Management and Support 1), 4 servers (DNS, DHCP, FTP, RADIUS), 2 routers, 1 multilayer switch, 1 switch. Centralizing servers and key devices is essential for security, organization, and access control.

By strategically placing switches and routing traffic via Layer 3 switches, weâ€™ve ensured that the network is both scalable and efficient without requiring additional routing hardware.

### 3. Justification for Architecture:
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Each department (Management, Study, Production, Support) is on a different VLAN, which ensures that sensitive data is isolated.
- **Layer 3 Switches**: These handle inter-VLAN routing, which is more cost-effective than adding extra routers.
- **Centralized Servers**: Moving some computers to the Server Room centralizes the management of critical systems, improving security and maintenance efficiency.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is scalable, allowing new devices or sectors to be added with minimal reconfiguration.
