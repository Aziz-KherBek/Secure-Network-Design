## Part 5 - Cost Breakdown and Resource Allocation

### 1. Introduction
We selected hardware components that strike a balance between performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency. The goal was to ensure the network infrastructure is robust enough to meet the client’s needs without over-investing in unnecessarily high-end equipment. For example, we chose mid-range €600 PCs that are capable of handling day-to-day business tasks without being overly specialized. Similarly, the selection of network switches, routers, and servers reflects a thoughtful approach to balancing functionality and budget.

The following is a detailed breakdown of the costs per sector.

### 2. Assumptions for Unit Costs:
- PC: €600 each
- Printer: €300 each
- IP Phone: €100 each
- Switch: €400 each
- Server: €2000
- Router: €800
- Multilayer Switch: €1500
- Firewall/ACLs (optional): €1200 per unit or configuration

### Management
- 4 PCs (instead of 5): 4 × €600 = €2400
- 1 Printer: €300
- 1 IP Phone: €100
- 1 Switch: €400  
**Total for Management**: €3200

### Study
- 8 PCs: 8 × €600 = €4800
- 1 Printer: €300
- 1 IP Phone: €100
- 1 Switch: €400  
**Total for Study**: €5600

### Server Room
- 2 Computers (moved): €1200
- 1 Server: €2000
- 1 Router: €800
- 1 Multilayer Switch: €1500  
**Total for Server Room**: €5500

### Production
- 10 PCs: 10 × €600 = €6000
- 1 Printer: €300
- 1 IP Phone: €100
- 1 Switch: €400  
**Total for Production**: €6800

### Support 1
- 9 PCs (instead of 10): 9 × €600 = €5400
- 5 IP Phones: 5 × €100 = €500
- 1 Printer: €300
- 1 Switch: €400  
**Total for Support 1**: €6600

### Support 2
- 10 PCs: 10 × €600 = €6000
- 5 IP Phones: 5 × €100 = €500
- 1 Printer: €300
- 1 Switch: €400  
**Total for Support 2**: €7200

### Overall Cost Breakdown
- **Total PCs (43 PCs)**: 43 × €600 = €25,800
- **Total Printers (5)**: 5 × €300 = €1500
- **Total IP Phones (13)**: 13 × €100 = €1300
- **Total Switches (6)**: 6 × €400 = €2400
- **Server Room Equipment**: €5500  
**Grand Total (without firewall/ACLs)**: €36,500

### Adding firewall/ACL costs:
- **Physical Firewalls**: €42,500
- **Virtual ACL configuration**: €36,500 + €1200 = €37,700
